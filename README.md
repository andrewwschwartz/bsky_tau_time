# Tau Time on Bluesky
A little python script that posts “Tau Time” at 6:28 on my bluesky account @andrewwschwartz.com

Having never made a bot on Twitter before, I figured this would be a fun little project.
Heavily inspired by Cassidy's "Pi Time" twitter posts, Tau is just 2 * PI. So at 6:28 instead of 3:14, this script will post "Tau Time"
